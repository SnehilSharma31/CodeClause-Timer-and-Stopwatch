◉ This Repo showcases my project, that I've created for my Internship task at CodeClause.

◉ This web-based timer and stopwatch application is designed to help users effectively manage time and track elapsed time with ease. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application provides a range of functionalities to suit various timing needs.

◉ With the countdown timer feature, you can easily set a specific duration and let the application do the counting down for you. Whether you need to set a reminder for a task, a countdown for an event, or simply manage your time more efficiently, this application has you covered. The user-friendly interface allows you to input the desired duration either manually or by using convenient buttons, making it effortless to customize your timer. Once the timer starts, you can pause, resume, or reset it as needed. Additionally, when the timer reaches zero, a sound notification will play, ensuring you don't miss important deadlines or events.

◉ The stopwatch functionality enables you to track elapsed time accurately. Whether you're measuring the duration of a workout, timing a cooking process, or simply keeping track of time, the stopwatch feature provides a reliable tool. With the click of a button, you can start the stopwatch, and it will keep running until you pause, resume, or reset it. This allows you to conveniently monitor and record time intervals as necessary.

◉ The application's user-friendly interface ensures a smooth and intuitive experience. Visual indicators provide clear feedback on the completion of the timer or the running state of the stopwatch, allowing you to monitor the progress at a glance. The mobile-friendly design makes it accessible and convenient to use the timer and stopwatch on various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

◉ Whether you're a student managing study sessions, a professional keeping track of work intervals, or an athlete monitoring training sessions, this timer and stopwatch application offers essential functionalities for efficient time management and accurate time tracking. It simplifies the process, eliminates the need for manual timekeeping, and helps you stay organized and productive.
